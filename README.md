Welcome to my GitHub profile! I'm a PhD Candidate at the University of Edinburgh, where my research is at the intersection of control engineering, data science, and renewable energy. My goal is to develop intelligent, health-aware control systems that make wind power more reliable, sustainable, and cost-effective.

### ðŸ”¬ Research Focus & Interests

My primary research objective is to create and validate data-driven control strategies that mitigate component fatigue and extend the operational lifetime of wind turbines, with a particular focus on their electrical subsystems.

```bash

> Wind Turbine Reliability & Lifetime Extension
> HealthAware & Multi-Objective Control
> SCADA & Maintenance Data Analysis
> Predictive Maintenance & Anomaly Detection
> Machine Learning & LLMs
```
